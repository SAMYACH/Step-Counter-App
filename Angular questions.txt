What are decorators in Angular? 
Decorators are a design pattern or functions that define how Angular features work. They are used to make prior modifications to a class, service, or filter. Angular supports four types of decorators, they are:

Class Decorators
Property Decorators
Method Decorators
Parameter Decorators

 The Component is a fundamental block of Angular and multiple components will make up your application.

Directives are classes that add additional behavior to elements in your Angular applications .

Modules
A module is a place where we can group components, directives, services, and pipes. Module decides whether the components, directives, etc can be
 used by other modules, by exporting or hiding these elements. Every module is defined with a @NgModule decorator.
